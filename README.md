A simple little app to narrow down the total list of words a solution to [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) could be. As you make guesses in Wordle, update the fields in the app and the number of possible words in the list will decrease.

I made this in a few hours on a Saturday night just because I wanted to code something.

My friends and family were excited about it so I decided to host it here: [wordlehelper.dev](https://wordlehelper.dev/)
